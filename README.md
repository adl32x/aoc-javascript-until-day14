Advent of Code 2021 until halfway of the 14th day
=================================================

General stuff
-------------
Javascript in NodeJS. Mostly solved with for-loops, maps and reduce until the 14th day. Could have continued with some nifty recursion, but didn't manage to get a working solution. Day 15 started to smell like I need A* to solve this, which is for my skill level too much time to invest (without using outside libraries) so quitting here. Thanks for the puzzles!

I didn't put puzzle input into separate files. Copy pasting into VSCode and some quick formatting was always good enough to get the input into perfect format.


Day 3
-----
This one is ugly, I don't know how to handly binary nicely ðŸ™ˆ
